Meteorologists use the Saffir-Simpson Scale to classify the strength of hurricanes. 

The intensity is based on the maximum sustained wind speed of a storm as follows:

prompt the user for a wind speed


program should use this wind speed to display a message telling the user the hurricane's intensity based on the table above.

__________________________________________________________

Heres my homework : )

#!/usr/bin/env python3

# Ask for the speed.
speed = input('How fast is the wind blowing in miles per hr? ')


# Convert the distance to an integer.
speed = int(speed)

# Determine hurricane category.
if speed < 74:
    category_of_hurricane = 'Cat1'
elif speed <= 95:
    category_of_hurricane = 'Cat2'
elif speed <= 110:
    category_of_hurricane = 'Cat3'
elif speed <= 130:
    category_of_hurricane = 'Cat4'
else:
    category_of_hurricane = 'Cat5'


# display a message telling the user the hurricane's intensity

print('Looks like a {} hurricane.'.format(category_of_hurricane))

SOLUTION

# Introduction to Python Programming
# Lesson 03 Assignment
# Sample Solution

# Please note that this program takes advantage of the fact that
#   once a condition is met, the if structure is exited.  This
#   allows me to not need a lower limit in my conditions because
#   if the speed were below the minimum for that Category, the
#   program would have already printed the result and exited.

speed = eval(input("Please enter the wind speed: "))

if speed < 74:
    print ("This is not a hurricane")
elif speed <= 95:
    print ("Category 1")
elif speed <= 110:
    print ("Category 2")
elif speed <= 130:
    print ("Category 3")
elif speed <= 155:
    print ("Category 4")
else:
    print ("Category 5")
